# ðŸªƒ Boooooooomerang ðŸªƒ

Boomerang steems from the idea that most users do not care where there liquidity is (as long as it's not some shady chain...)
Therefore, instead of having to switch to a specific wallet, users can just download a browser extension.

It does two things :

1. Intercept calls from dApps (for instance, balances requests) and modify them to include all chains.

2. Intercept all transactions to make them gasless meta-transactions. The signature can then be relayer on multiple chains, and thanks to cross chain messaging, call the right function on the right chain with bridged tokens.

This provides a chain-agnostic experience for users, with no additionnal work for dapps.

The current implementation uses LayerZero as a token bridge and Hyperlane for cross-chain messaging.

We plan to implement OpenGSN or Biconomy for gasless tx.

However we were not able to finish.
